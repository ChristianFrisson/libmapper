% Roadmap for libmapper

This document contains information on what remains to be accomplished in
the library, and what features might be added in the future.

Current Status
==============

The current status is summarized here:

* Name/port allocation works. Allocation speedup works.

* A device and signal API is established, allowing polling of the
  network, responding to incoming signal values, and updating
  registered output signals.

* Routings (called Links) and Mappings can be established, and all
  required signal conditioning functions have been implemented.

* A device is able to also monitor the network and store information
  about other devices, signals, links, and mappings, and this
  information can be queried.

* MaxMSP and puredata external object working.

* Python bindings working for end-device functionality.

Tasks To Do
===========

The following tasks currently need to be accomplished:

* Create example program for interfacing with Wiimote, HID? Try to do 
  this through pd objects with libmapper external. Kinect? (Joe)

* Include some Max/MSP standalone versions of controllers, Granul8,
  etc? (Joe)

* We need some sort of interface for Linux - webmapper? Qt?

* Documentation, tutorials. 
    * External API. (Steve)
    * How to create a signal-combining device?
    * Videos.
        * Connect slider
        * Wiimote library
        * Kinect OpenFrameworks
        * maxmsp
        * puredata
        * using expressions
    * Move code hosting to GitHub?
    * Enable download counting on idmil.org?
    * Explicitly state known deficiencies
        * No many-to-one mapping
        * Explicit mapping only (no destination state queries)
        * No stored curves or tables

Lower priority tasks
====================

* Python bindings for monitor functionality.

* Java bindings.

* Ensure correct action is taken (if any) when signals are registered
  and unregistered, or devices disappear and reappear. (Depends on
  namespace hashing, save for later.)

* Implement OSC aliasing for signal connections.

* Implement bidirectional communication for state queries.

* Port to Windows.

* Add a user interaction to "testmonitor", allowing users to create
  connections in a text-based environment.  Although there will be
  graphical interfaces, described in the next section, it should be
  considered useful for the library to come with a simple tool to
  monitor and possibly control the network, so that a user may test
  the examples.

* Look into usage on embedded platforms. (Works on gumstix!)

* In support of the previous point, implement the proposal for
  pre-defined expressions ("fixed" processing type).

* Consider using a back-end such as SQLite for database searching.
  (May be more efficient for supporting large networks.)

* Check for disallowed OSC characters. Security testing.
    * Add default MAX_CONNECTIONS, MAX_SIGNALS

External tasks
==============

There are some tasks which address uses of the library/protocol rather
than being tasks for the library development itself.

* Development of SuperCollider usage, either using library or
  reimplemented in SC to some extent.

* Development of browser-based GUI.

* Modify some of the FAUST architectures (e.g., Jack) to automatically
  create a libmapper interface for input and output signals.

* Wrap all STK instruments as mapper-compatible synths.

Future developments
===================

Ideas that we consider to have potential but are not being considered
for current work.

* Audio-rate signal connections via Jack, SoundFlower, etc.

* Interpolation for filtering of sporadic signals

* Many-to-one mapping.

* Add documentation and icon URLs to device properties. Add to GUI.
